I have been using Terraform in production for almost a year and the experience has been pretty great so far. However, Terraform does have some shortcomings. In the Terraform Tricks blog series I want to show how to work around some of these shortcomings, as well as explore some of the less-known (or undocumented) awesomeness of Terraform. In this blog post I will discuss various options for overriding variables without the need for excessive code-duplication.
